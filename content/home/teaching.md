## ELEC 220 -- Fundamentals of Computer Architecture
While at Rice, I helped develop a new curriculum for the ELEC 220, Fundamentals of Computer Architecture course. 
We focused on making a course that would enforce learning through hands on activities in a lab environment.

## VIP -- Vertically Integrated Projects

Rice offers a program that allows for gradstudents to work with undergraduates and professors for a project. This is called [Vertically Integrated Projects or (VIP)](https://vip.rice.edu/).
I have been working with a VIP team for since 2016. 
See more info on our group, Parallel Hardware Applications in Science and Technology (PHAST), [here](http://cavallaro.rice.edu/vip-group/).
