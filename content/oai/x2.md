The X2 handover is a handover from eNB to eNB with minimal coordination from the core network. The common alternative is an S1 handover.

This feature will soon be merged into the develop branch of OAI. For now, it is in its own branch. This page is me testing that branch. There is a [page on the wiki that discusses this feature](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g/wikis/how-to-perform-a-x2-ho).

# Download the X2 Branch
I am in a 3 laptop setup, 2 eNBs and 1 core network. I want to preserve my setup so I am cloning the X2 branch in a different directory than my main setup. 

```bash
cd
mkdir x2
cd x2
git clone https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g.git
git checkout x2
```

The commit that I am using is: 932f6017facea2a0a73010d72c4bb5fc3a1000c5

# Build the repo
```bash
cd openairinterface5g
./cmake_targets/build_oai -I -w USRP # Install dependencies
./cmake_targets/build_oai --eNB -w USRP # compile the enb
```
# Edit the config file
I like to copy the eNB config file to the root of the project.
```bash
cp targets/PROJECTS/GENERIC-LTE-EPC/CONF/enb.band7.tm1.50PRB.usrpb210.conf .
```

Edit the file to add the appropriate IP addresses using your favorite text editor (VIM). 
```
mme_ip_address = ( { ipv4 = "YOUR IP HERE"; 
....
NETWORK_INTERFACES:
{
    ENB_INTERFACE_NAME_FOR_S1_MME = "YOUR INTERFACE HERE DO IFCONFIG TO FIGURE OUT";
    ENB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_S1_MME   = "IP ADDRESS OF ABOVE INTERFACE";
    ENB_INTERFACE_NAME_FOR_S1U    = "YOUR INTERFACE HERE DO IFCONFIG TO FIGURE OUT";
    ENB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_S1U      = "IP ADDRESS OF ABOVE INTERFACE";
    ENB_PORT_FOR_S1U              = 2152;
    
    ENB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_X2C      = "IP ADDRESS OF ABOVE INTERFACE";
    ENB_PORT_FOR_X2C              = 36422
};
```

An example of my log file is [here](../enb_x2.conf)

# PROBLEMS:
Currently, it looks like there is a bug with the UHD drivers. On my USRPB210, only 1 radio came on (I think it was the RX). The [log file here](../x2_enb.log) repeats the same error continuously.

I'll try this again later after trying to force my UHD driver to revert to an older version.
