Over the last few years of gradschool, I've needed to write many conferences and a few journal papers.
However, no one clearly explains how to do this. 
One learns it along the way largely from getting criticisms from coauthors and being a reviewer for other peoples' works. 

I am writing a guide on how to write papers to share everything I've learned with those new to it. 
I'm also writing this for myself to server as a style guide and quick reference when writing new papers.

 My goal by the end of this is to make a cookiecutter template that can easily be used by anyone to setup an IEEE conference paper. 
 
 Topics covered will include:
 
 * Figures
 * Tables
 * Acronyms
 * References
