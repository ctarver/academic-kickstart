Carrier aggregation is the sending of multiple LTE carriers simultaneously on seperate carriers to increase the total bandwidth. LTE by default has a maximum bandwidth of 20 MHz. By aggregating multiple LTE carriers, we can get more bandwidth and hence faster speeds. It was introduced in 3GPP Rel. 13? and was later expanded upon to allow more carriers.


# Challenges
## Larger bandwidths
Carrier aggregation is difficult for DPD firs

## Discontiguous Transmissions
