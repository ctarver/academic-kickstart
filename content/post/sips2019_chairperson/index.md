I will be chairing technical session T2 at the [IEEE International Workshop on Signal Processing Systems](http://sips2019.org/) on October 22nd in Nanjing China.
This session will be focusing on Machine Learning and feature the following papers:

* "RNN Models for Rain Detection"
* "Improving Reliability of ReRAM-based DNN Implementation through Novel Weight Distribution"
* "Exploration of On-device End-to-End Acoustic Modeling with Neural Networks"
* "Memory Reduction Through Experience Classification for Deep Reinforcement Learning with Prioritized Experience"
