One of my papers from 2017 was given a shoutout by Derek Kozel in February 2019 at the FOSDEM conference. The talk is shown is an overview of DPD and is on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJVPXVRIHY8). In the talk, the speaker refers to my work as "a really interesting find." 

The result shown is from my paper titled ["Multi Component Carrier, Sub-band DPD and GNURadio Implementation"](https://chancetarver.com/publication/tarver-2017-multi/) which was published at ISCAS. In this paper, we feature a sub-band approach to DPD which only targets spurious emissions that are in violation of some emission mask to save on the complexity. 

[Derek Kozel](https://www.derekkozel.com/) is a PhD student at Cardiff Univeristy. We are actually working together to create a Google Summer of Code project to implement DPD in GNURadio.
