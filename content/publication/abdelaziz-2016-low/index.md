abstract: "Noncontiguous transmission schemes combined withhigh power-efficiency requirements pose big challenges for radiotransmitter and power amplifier (PA) design and implementation.Due to the nonlinear nature of the PA, severe unwanted emissionscan   occur,   which   can   potentially   interfere   with   neighboringchannel  signals  or  even  desensitize  the  own  receiver  in  fre-quency division duplexing (FDD) transceivers. In this article, tosuppress  such  unwanted  emissions,  a  low-complexity  sub-band DPD  solution,  specifically  tailored  for  spectrally  noncontiguous transmission   schemes   in   low-cost   devices,   is   proposed.   The proposed  technique  aims  at  mitigating  only  the  selected  spurious  intermodulation  distortion  components  at  the  PA  output,hence  allowing  for  substantially  reduced  processing  complexity compared to classical linearization solutions. Furthermore, novel decorrelation  based  parameter  learning  solutions  are  also  proposed and formulated, which offer reduced computing complexityin  parameter  estimation  as  well  as  the  ability  to  track  time-varying  features  adaptively.  Comprehensive  simulation  and  RF measurement  results  are  provided,  using  a  commercial  LTE-Advanced  mobile  PA,  to  evaluate  and  validate  the  effectiveness of  the  proposed  solution  in  real  world  scenarios.  The  obtainedresults  demonstrate  that  highly  efficient  spurious  components uppression  can  be  obtained  using  the  proposed  solutions."
